# ANN Final Project 2024
### Biotech Stock Prediction Using LSTMs and a VAE
In this project, we sought to test the efficacy of using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode and normalize biotech stock data.
To test the VAE's effects on this data, we trained two Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models: one took the stock data as input and the other took as input the 
VAE's encodings of the stock data.
